Compiling fish databases across North America

This project had the aim of compiling fish sampling data across as many lakes as possible, across North America and for time-period if possible. We were able to collect and aggregate data from over 20000 lakes, with data starting as early as the 1700s, and over 2000 fish species. 
We identified data sources using Google Dataset Search, Mendeley Data, knb, OBIS, FishBase, GBIF, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada.
